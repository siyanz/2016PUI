**Learning Goals**

 * To give you some basic experience with critiquing a user interface
 * To give you some experience in reflecting on why an interface is good or bad

**Overview**

You should submit one or more images of a single product that you think is either well-designed or poorly designed (choose one). Along with your image(s), include a short write-up (5-10 sentences) describing why you think the product is well-designed or poorly designed and why you chose it. Choose an object/interface that you have experience with, either hardware or software. This is an _individual_ assignment.

At this point, we have not yet discussed many of the principles of what makes a user interface good or bad. Use what we have discussed so far, as well as your best intuition, as to why a user interface is good or bad.
